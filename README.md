# Sorting Visualizer App 

## Construction Details
This application was initally bootstrapped in React and written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It solidified my understanding of js, imports, and many aspects of frontend development while allowing me to practice writing algorithms that are actually at play under the hood. The algorithms include Mergesort, InsertionSort, and QuickSort, and you can check it out [here](https://jasonyang295.github.io/sortingvisualizer/).

## Implementation 
This app is hosted for free on GH pages. In order to use the visualizer, click one of the sorts and watch it happen! When it finishes, you have to generate a new array -- the visualizer won't do it for you. 

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
